== Playing with Java modules

== Project Jigsaw

The https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/[primary goals] of this Project were to:

* Make it *easier for developers* to construct and *maintain libraries and large applications*
* *Improve the security and maintainability* of Java SE Platform Implementations in general, and the JDK in particular
* Enable *improved application performance*
* Enable the *Java SE Platform to scale down*

=== Project Jigsaw JEPs

* 200: The Modular JDK
* 201: Modular Source Code
* 220: Modular Run-Time Images
* 260: Encapsulate Most Internal APIs
* 261: Module System
* 282: jlink: The Java Linker

=== Modular JDK

== Module system for applications

=== class path

`java -cp ....`

* everything on the classpath is visible to all other classes
* difficult to hide implementation details and internal classes
* difficult to exclude unused modules from runtime image (e.g. small docker image)

=== module system

* modules decide what is visible outside of the module
* define which other modules are used (compile and runtime)

=== howto modularize (legacy) applications?

* place `module-info.java` on sources root
** `exports` makes packages visible from outside the module
** `requires` makes external packages visible from inside the module
** `opens` makes packages visible *on runtime* from anywhere
** legacy (non modular) code in jar files are in *automatic modules* generated from the jar file name

=== module path replaces classpath

instead of class path, use module path

```
 java [options] -m <module>[/<mainclass>] [args...]
 java [options] --module <module>[/<mainclass>] [args...]
           (to execute the main class in a module)
```

=== module path with javac

* similar with `javac`
* maven supports java modules
* intellij has syntax support
